# stock-analysis

Overview of Project:

The purpose of this analysis is to analyse a dataset of the entire stock market over the last few years. There are 2 scripts developed thru VBA. Original script and refactored script. Although the original code works well for a dozen of stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute. So, a refactored script was developed. 

On the excel spreadsheet,  there are 2 options to click, 
    -	Run All Stock Analysis – Original Script  
    -	Run All Stocks Analysis – Refactored Script
The last button is to Clear Cells.

Provided are screenshots results according to year and code elapsed time
 
Results:

1)	Run All Stock Analysis – Original Script  for 2017 with run time.

Summary:

In summary refactoring the original code makes a difference. 
  Advantages of Refactoring Code:
      -	Saves time executing the job
      -	Logic is reviewed and possibility to correct for any code inconsistencies
      -	Script is modified to become more structured and well-organized
  Disadvantages of Refactoring Code:
      -	If original script has not been properly commented and documented  will be a nightmare to currently modifying it
      -	Their will be a possibility of wrong data results
